# Reflection
BrighterScript provides some basic reflection support to help with class and function discovery. Plain BrightScript does not offer any type of function discovery, so BrighterScript had to get creative in the way we handle reflection. 

## Reflection with BrightScript projects
Unfortunately, BrighterScript reflection is completely dependent on some automation within the BrighterScript transpiler. This means that you cannot have reflection or discovery of classes or functions from projects that were not transpiled by BrighterScript. Until BrightScript supports native function discovery, there is no way around this.

## Function and class discovery (supported cross-project)
Each BrighterScript namespace is responsible for declaring all of the classes and methods that are defined within it. In this way, we can prevent collisions between multiple BrightScript projects or libraries and support interoperability between them. However, this doees mean you need to know the namespace of the object you are searching for. 

Here's an example:

```VB
namespace Vertibrates
    class Duck
    end class

    class BabyDuck extends Duck
    end class

    sub TeachDuckToSwim(duck)
    end sub
end namespace

sub Main()
    classes = Reflect(Vertibrates).classes
end sub
```

And here's the corresponding reflection information:

```VB
function Vertibrates__Reflect()
    result = {
        classes: [],
        functions: []
        namespaces: []
    }
    Duck = {
        name: "Duck",
        extends: invalid
    }
    if Type(Vertibrates_Duck) = "Function" then
        Duck.constructor = Vertibrates_Duck
    else
        Duck.constructor = sub()
            #error "class Vertibrates.Duck is not currently in scope" 
        end sub
    end if
    classes.Append(Duck)

    BabyDuck = {
        name: "BabyDuck",
        extends: Duck
    }
    if Type(Vertibrates_BabyDuck) = "Function" then
        BabyDuck.constructor = Vertibrates_BabyDuck
    else
        BabyDuck.constructor = sub()
            #error "class Vertibrates.BabyDuck is not currently in scope" 
        end sub
    end if
end function

sub Main()
    classes = Vertibrates__Reflect().classes
end sub
```

The `Reflect()` method is dynamically generated by the BrighterScript transpiler, based on all all of the scopes in the entire project.
